        <p>A long time ago, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green
And there was more kinds of &nbsp;animals &nbsp;&nbsp;than &nbsp;you've &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen,
And &nbsp;&nbsp;they &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run around free while the world was bein' born,
And &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lovliest of all was the Unicorn.<br><br></p>
        <p>
There &nbsp;&nbsp;was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green alligators and long-neck geese.
There &nbsp;&nbsp;was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humpy bumpy camels and chimpanzees.
There &nbsp;&nbsp;was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;e&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;h&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;s,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but sure as you're born
The &nbsp;&nbsp;lovliest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all was the Unicorn.<br><br></p>
        <p>
But &nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord seen some sinnin', and it caused him pain.
He &nbsp;&nbsp;says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stand back, I'm gonna make it rain."
He &nbsp;&nbsp;says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey Brother Noah, I'll tell ya whatcha do.
Go &nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build me a floatin' zoo.<br><br></p>
        <p>
And &nbsp;&nbsp;you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take two alligators and a couple of geese,
Two &nbsp;&nbsp;humpy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bumpy camels and two chimpanzees.
Take &nbsp;&nbsp;two &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;catsandratsandelephants, but sure as you're born
Noah, &nbsp;&nbsp;don't &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you forget my Unicorn."<br><br</p>
        <p>
Now &nbsp;&nbsp;Noah &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was there, he answered the callin'
And &nbsp;&nbsp;he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finished up the ark just as the rain was fallin'. He&nbsp;&nbsp; marched &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the animals two by two,
And &nbsp;&nbsp;he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called out as they went through,<br><br></p>
        <p>
"Hey &nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got your two alligators adn your couple of geese,
Your &nbsp;&nbsp;humpy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bumpy camels and your chimpanzees.
Got&nbsp;&nbsp; your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;e&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;h&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp; -- but Lord, I'm so forlorn
'Cause&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just don't see no Unicorn."<br><br></p>
        <p>
Ol' &nbsp;Noah &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked out through the drivin' rain
But &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unicorns were hidin', playin' silly games.
They&nbsp;&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kickin' and splashin' in the misty morn,
Oh &nbsp;&nbsp;them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silly Unicorn.<br><br></p>
        <p>
The &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goat started goatin', and the snake started snakin',
The &nbsp;&nbsp;elephant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;started elephantin', and the boat started shaking'.
The &nbsp;&nbsp;mouse &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;started squeakin', and the lion started roarin',
And &nbsp;&nbsp;everyone's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abourd but the Unicorn.<br><br></p>
        <p>
I &nbsp;&nbsp;mean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the green alligators and the long-neck geese,
The &nbsp;&nbsp;humpy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bumpy camels and the chimpanzees.
Noah &nbsp;&nbsp;cried,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Close the door 'cause the rain is pourin'--
And &nbsp;&nbsp;we &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just can't wait for them Unicorn."<br><br></p>
        <p>
Then &nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ark started movin', and it drifted with the tide,
And &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unicorns looked up from the rock and cried.
And &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water come up and sort of floated them away--
That's &nbsp;&nbsp;why &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you've never seen a Unicorn to this day.<br><br></p>
        <p>
You'll &nbsp;&nbsp;see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of alligators and a whole mess of geese.
You'll&nbsp;&nbsp; see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; humpy bumpy camels and lots of chimpanzees.
You'll &nbsp;&nbsp;see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;d&nbsp;e&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;h&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;t&nbsp;s&nbsp;, but sure as you're born
You're&nbsp;&nbsp; never &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gonna see no Unicorn
